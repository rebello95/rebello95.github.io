# Introduction

Over the past few years, I've been asked questions by several individuals about how I manage my personal finances. Additionally, I have a some younger siblings who are in college and have not yet joined the workforce, but are seeking to learn more about how they should be thinking about financial planning. Finance is something that I personally find very interesting and thoroughly enjoy learning about. That said, today's financial system is not entirely straightforward and people looking to start their financial journey can be easily overwhelmed since most formal educational institutions do not require classes on finance, taxes, etc. to be taken in order to graduate. It is for these reasons that I decided to write a synopsis of what I believe to be the most important financial components to learn about in order to set oneself up for financial success.

I've broken this information up into sections below in an effort to make it more digestable. It's worth mentioning that there are entire books written about each section, so this is by no means meant to be exhaustive. Rather, I've written this with the goal of providing high-level context on each topic along with some actionable ideas. I've also provided inline links to external websites to help provide further reading material. Before reading, please take note of the [disclaimer](#disclaimer).

# Credit

## Credit scores

[Credit](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/credit-education/faqs/what-is-credit/) is essentially the ability to borrow funds with the understanding that you'll repay the lender at a later time. Today, lenders use [credit scores](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit_score.asp) to determine your "credit worthiness" - how likely you are to repay loaned money in the future. The higher your credit score in the range of 300-850, the more easily you'll be able to borrow money and the lower your interest rates on that borrowed money will be (see the [interest rates section below](#interest-rates) for details on why this is important).

Credit scores of 750 and higher are considered excellent, and you will usually receive the best interest rates with a credit score in this range. It's important to start building your credit from an early age so that you have a good credit score when you need it (such as when you want to purchase a house or a car).

There are 3 main agencies that report, update, and store consumers' credit scores: Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion. Scores are generally calculated by analyzing several aspects of consumers' financial history, and they are weighted in the following way (notes on each to follow):

- 35% payment history
- 30% credit utilization
- 15% length of credit history
- 10% type of credit in use
- 10% new credit

You can monitor your credit score for free either using the systems provided by your credit card provider or bank, or via a site like [Experian](https://www.experian.com).

See the individual sections below for more details on each, as well as [starter credit cards](#starter-credit-cards) for information on how to start building your credit score.

### Payment history

[Payment history](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/credit-score/payment-history/) is a measure of whether outstanding debt is paid back on time. (Are credit card bills paid? Are mortgage payments being made on time? What about car payments?) **You should aim to have a perfect payment history and should avoid any late or missed bill payments on outstanding credit, as this will negatively affect your score.**

### Credit utilization

[Credit utilization](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-utilization-rate.asp) measures how much of a consumer's available credit is currently in use. For example, if your only line of credit is a credit card with a $1,000 credit limit and you have a balance of $250 on that card, your credit utilization ratio is 25% ($250 / $1,000).

Credit utilization includes _all_ of your credit cards. For example:

__Card 1__
Credit limit: $1,000
Balance: $250

__Card 2__
Credit limit: $5,000
Balance: $800

Utilization = ($250 + $800) / ($1,000 + $6,000) = 15%

**[The lower your credit utilization, the better](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/what-is-the-best-percentile-for-credit-utilization/) - try to keep your utilization between 1-10% (important: 1% credit usage is better than no usage [according to Experian](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/what-is-the-best-percentile-for-credit-utilization/)).**

### Length of credit history

Just as people build trust through relationships over time, credit agencies build trust in you as a borrower over time. Having a track record of good payment history and credit utilization (over the period of years) is considered as part of your credit score. Thus, **it is important to start building credit early on, typically by opening a credit card, keeping its utilization between 1-10%, and paying off the balance in full each month.**

The amount of time you have had lines of credit open is also taken into account in your score. For example, if all of your credit cards were opened within the past year, you do not have a lengthy track record of good credit for lenders to see. For this reason, **it is best practice to avoid closing credit cards unnecessarily, as doing so may reduce the length of your credit history and will also reduce your total available credit (thus increasing your credit utilization).**

### Type of credit in use

There are three types of credit accounts:

1. **Revolving**: A line of credit which usually has a cap (credit limit) and requires regular payments over time. Credit cards are considered revolving lines of credit.
2. **Installment**: The classic example of an installment credit line is a loan (home loan, car loan, student loan, etc.). These are for fixed amounts of money and require payments at regular intervals.
3. **Open**: Open credit is not very common, and allows borrowers to charge up to a specific amount (like a credit card), but it must be repaid in full each month.

As a general guideline, **having varying types of credit accounts (typically credit card(s) and loan(s)) helps to show credit agencies that you are a trustworthy and reliable borrower.**

(More details are available [here](https://www.creditkarma.com/credit-cards/i/how-types-credit-affect-score).)

### New credit (credit inquiries)

A [credit inquiry](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-inquiry.asp) occurs when an institution requests credit information from a credit reporting agency. Inquiries (also known as "pulls") are either hard inquiries or soft inquiries, and require the borrower's social security number:

- **Hard inquiry**: Provides the requester with a full credit report and credit history on the potential borrower, and is usually pulled when a borrower applies for a new line of credit (like a credit card or loan). These inquiries typically cause your credit score to be slightly reduced, and appear on your credit history for 2 years.
- **Soft inquiry**: Provides the requester with basic information on the potential borrower, and is usually pulled in order to pre-qualify a borrower, show potential offers, or to check a credit score. These inquiries do not reduce your credit score and do not show up in your credit history.

A high number of hard credit inquiries in a short amount of time (such as those caused by applying for several credit cards at once) can be interpreted by lenders as an attempt to significantly expand available credit, which is why they affect your credit score. **When applying for credit, be mindful of the fact that doing so will reduce your credit score and avoid applying for multiple lines of credit in a short period of time.**

## Interest rates

Interest rates are important because they can significantly affect the amount of money you will be required to pay back when you borrow funds (e.g., taking out a loan, using credit cards, etc.). The lower your interest rate on a loan, the less money you will pay in interest over time and the cheaper it is for you to borrow that money.

To illustrate, consider these 30 year loans (similar to those that one would take out for a home mortgage):

__Loan 1__
Borrowed amount: $100,000
Interest rate: **3%**
Monthly payment: $421.60
Total interest paid after 30 years: $51,777.45
Total cost of the loan after 30 years: $151,777.45

__Loan 2__
Borrowed amount: $100,000
Interest rate: **5%**
Monthly payment: $536.82
Total interest paid after 30 years: $93,255.78
Total cost of the loan after 30 years: $193,255.78

**As you can see, the second loan has monthly payments >$100 more than the first loan and costs >$41K more over the course of the loan.** To play around with rates and how they affect the cost of loans, you can use [this website](https://www.mortgagecalculator.org).

Interest applied to credit cards can be even more costly because it **compounds over time**.

For example, consider a credit card with an APR (Annual Percentage Rate) of 20%. This is the interest rate that you'll pay over the course of a year, and means that the daily interest rate is 0.054% (20% / 365 days). If your card has a balance of $1,000 on January 1, $0.54 of interest will be added to your balance (0.054% * $1,000) on January 2. The next day, the interest will be applied to your new balance of $1,000.54, and the process will repeat until the end of each of the monthly billing cycle. On January 31, the new balance would be $1,016.74. If the balance remains unpaid for another 31 days, another $17.02 of interest would be accrued ($1,016.74 * (0.054% * 31 days)). Notice that the interest of the second 31 days is higher than the first 31 days - this is because the interest _compounds_ over time, meaning that you're essentially accuring interest on the interest you accrued in the previous billing period.
