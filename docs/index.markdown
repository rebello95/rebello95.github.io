Hey there! I'm Michael Rebello. I've been doing iOS development since iOS 4 üì±,
and currently work at [Lyft üöó](https://lyft.com) as a Staff Engineer where I
was on a very small team tasked with building the
[redesign of the Lyft rider app](https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/08/lyft-is-testing-a-new-rider-experience-with-a-small-percentage-of-users),
was one of the founding team members
of [Envoy Mobile](https://github.com/lyft/envoy-mobile)
![Envoy Mobile]({{ site.asset_baseurl }}/small/envoy_mobile.png){:style="width: 25px; height: 20px;"},
and am currently focused on networking & reliability.

Additionally, I'm working on [Path](https://www.pathapp.io)
![Path]({{ site.asset_baseurl }}/small/path.png){:style="width: 20px; height: 20px;"} -
a platform to find the best spots through short-form,
relatable video reviews from local experts and recommendations from friends.

Prior, I started and sold two small software companies and did a few
consulting projects here and there.

I currently live in San Diego with my wife Milla and our

# Past Work

## Lyft (2016 - Present)

When I first joined Lyft, I spent most of my time working on Shared Rides.
After leading an independent technical effort, I was asked to join a very small ‚Äúlab‚Äù team of designers and 3
engineers tasked with [redesigning the Lyft rider app](https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/08/lyft-is-testing-a-new-rider-experience-with-a-small-percentage-of-users)
which became the basis for the Lyft app we know today. I now lead a team that I started
within the mobile infrastructure org which is focused on networking and reliability.
I was also one of the founding team members and maintainers of the open-source
[Envoy Mobile](https://github.com/lyft/envoy-mobile), and am an editor of the
[Lyft Engineering Blog](https://eng.lyft.com).

## Path - Co-Founder & CTO (2020 - Present)

Co-founded [Path](https://www.pathapp.io), a platform to find the best spots through short-form,
relatable video reviews from local experts and recommendations from friends. In 2021, the company raised a
funding round led by [75 & Sunny Ventures](https://www.75andsunny.vc/labs). As the sole technical
team member, I built Path's backend servers and iOS app from the ground up, and work closely with our product
team and investors.

## ActivityHub/NEXMachine - iOS Product & Architecture (2014 - 2016)

Joined ActivityHub (NEXMachine) to build their iOS calendar app and backend which integrated with several
external services. A few months later, they acquired my company (Scholastic Connections),
and I began leading product development for both initiatives before later closing down Scholastic Connections
as ActivityHub refocused on the enterprise space as a Salesforce partner. I then led product engineering,
hired new engineers, contributed as an IC, and participated in investor meetings.

## Flounder Apps (Acquired in 2016) - Co-Founder (2013 - 2016)

Co-founded Flounder Apps, focused on building
[Ambition: Strategy War Game](https://appadvice.com/app/ambition-strategy-war-game/850863885) ‚Äì an iOS app
designed as a complex, turn-based strategy game.
The product was acquired by another organization in 2016.

## Scholastic Connections (Acquired in 2015) - Founder (2014 - 2015)

Founded Scholastic Connections, a company that partnered with classroom management providers to create an
iOS app which provided teachers and families with easy access to their students' data.
In 2014, the company was acquired by ActivityHub (NEXMachine), after which the product expanded to Android
and grew its userbase before ultimately being shut down when ActivityHub pivoted towards the enterprise space.

## Independent iOS Developer (2011 - 2014)

Contracted independently on iOS projects for several companies. Additionally,
I created a few of my own apps which were distributed on the App Store, some of which were eventually sold off.
