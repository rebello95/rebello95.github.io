Hey there! I'm Michael Rebello. I've been doing iOS development since iOS 4,
and currently work at [Buf](https://buf.build) building the future of APIs
through Protobuf (particularly on mobile!).

I'm also a co-founder of [Path](https://www.pathapp.io) -
a platform to find the best spots through short-form,
relatable video reviews from local experts and recommendations from friends.

Prior, I worked as a Staff Engineer at Lyft for 6 years after starting and selling
two small software companies and doing a few consulting projects.

I currently live in San Diego with my wife Milla and our
[two cats, Pushkin & Bailey]({{ site.asset_baseurl }}/full/cats.jpg).
In my free time, I enjoy baking, hiking, bouldering (though I'm not yet
brave enough to try it in the wild outside of a climbing gym), and learning
to speak Russian.

This page contains a little bit about my work background – feel free to
[contact me](mailto:me@michaelrebello.com)!

# Past Work

## Buf (2022 - Present)

[Building the future of APIs through Protobuf!](https://buf.build)

## Lyft (2016 - 2022)

My first few months at Lyft were focused on shipping features to improve Shared Rides.
After leading an architecture effort on the iOS driver app, I was asked to join a very small “lab” team of
designers and 2 other iOS engineers tasked with
[redesigning the rider app](https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/08/lyft-is-testing-a-new-rider-experience-with-a-small-percentage-of-users)
which boosted bookings and became the foundation for the Lyft rider app we know today.
I was one of the founding members and maintainers of the open-source
[Envoy Mobile](https://github.com/lyft/envoy-mobile) project, was responsible for writing Lyft’s iOS
experimentation, analytics, and gRPC streaming components, and co-led Lyft’s
[mobile-wide adoption of Protobuf APIs](https://eng.lyft.com/lyfts-journey-through-mobile-networking-d8e13c938166) -
authoring a Go-based Swift Protobuf generator and partnering with product teams to achieve 100% utilization.
I now lead a new team in the mobile infrastructure org which is focused on networking and reliability,
and am an editor of the [Lyft Engineering Blog](https://eng.lyft.com).

## Path - Co-Founder & CTO (2020 - Present)

Co-founded [Path](https://www.pathapp.io), a platform to find the best spots through short-form,
relatable video reviews from local experts and recommendations from friends.
In 2021, the company raised a funding round led by [75 & Sunny Ventures](https://www.75andsunny.vc/labs).
As the sole technical team member, I built Path's backend servers and iOS app from the ground up.
I work closely with the team to iterate based on data and user feedback, and am involved in investor
relations/fundraising.

## ActivityHub/NEXMachine - iOS Product & Architecture (2014 - 2016)

Joined ActivityHub (NEXMachine) to build their iOS calendar app and backend which integrated with several
external services. A few months later, they acquired my company (Scholastic Connections),
and I began leading product development for both initiatives before later closing down Scholastic Connections
as ActivityHub refocused on the enterprise space as a Salesforce partner. I then led product engineering,
hired new engineers, contributed as an IC, and participated in investor meetings.

## Flounder Apps (Acquired in 2016) - Co-Founder (2013 - 2016)

Co-founded Flounder Apps, focused on building
[Ambition: Strategy War Game](https://appadvice.com/app/ambition-strategy-war-game/850863885) – an iOS app
designed as a complex, turn-based strategy game.
The product was acquired by another organization in 2016.

## Scholastic Connections (Acquired in 2015) - Founder (2014 - 2015)

Founded Scholastic Connections, a company that partnered with classroom management providers to create an
iOS app which provided teachers and families with easy access to their students' data.
In 2014, the company was acquired by ActivityHub (NEXMachine), after which the product expanded to Android
and grew its user base before ultimately being shut down when
ActivityHub pivoted towards the enterprise space.

## Independent iOS Developer (2011 - 2014)

Contracted independently on iOS projects for several companies. Additionally,
I created a few of my own apps which were distributed on the App Store, some of which were eventually sold off.
